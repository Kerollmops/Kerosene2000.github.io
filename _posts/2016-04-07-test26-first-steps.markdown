Genetic algorithms and neural networks, that's what leads us to be interested on the production of a race game.
But not a classic race game, it's is controlled by artificial intelligences.
But not classic AI, genetically trained AI with neural networks inside !

There is three parts in this project:

1. The Virtual Machine - *run all the physics steps for each cars at cpu speed !*
2. The Graphic - *display the buffered race at controlled speed for a best debug.*
3. The Genetic Algorithm - *answer the VM when asking movement for each car.*

### **Neuroevolution - Car learns to drive** - *The significant source of inspiration*
